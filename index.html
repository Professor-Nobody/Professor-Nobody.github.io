       </h1>
       <p> Testing the networks is essential in order to maintain security for the organizational information. The difficulties in networks have to be recognized by the security professional so that they can be solved before effecting the organization operations (James S. Tiller, 2005) </p>

                    WHEN PEOPLE GET HURT, THEY LEARN TO HATE… WHEN PEOPLE HURT OTHERS, THEY BECOME HATED AND RACKED WITH GUILT. BUT KNOWING THAT PAIN ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE KIND. PAIN ALLOWS PEOPLE TO GROW… AND HOW YOU GROW IS UP TO YOU.

                    Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain. suffering and futility. Listen, everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace initiates war. and hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses causal relationships that cannot be separated.
